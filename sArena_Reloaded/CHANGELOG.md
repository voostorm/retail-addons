- The frames bugging out seem to be related to the game taking a dump; arena1-3 macros does not work either when this happens. Hard to test and I assume its just Blizzard being Blizzard.

2.3.4b
- Fix DR Text always being active regardless of settings.
- Fix lua errors from now new restrictions from Blizzard related to castbar types (uninterruptible status).
    This means currently not possible to color/texture an uninterruptible cast without some sort of wonky workaround maybe.
    Disabled for now and will just color depending on cast/channel, this may be confusing on uninterruptible casts.
    Consider Modern Castbars setting which uses default colored textures for now until a fix may arrive.

2.3.4
- Update Mes profile

2.3.3e
- Add test global to skip DR Warning/Reload for testing. Macro: /run sArenaSkipDrWarning = true

- Fix interrupt checker for Midnight
- Restructure and cleanup a few things behind the scenes.

2.3.3b
- Midnight: Fix party target feature due to new Beta changes.
- Midnight: Headsup: Currently if you reload UI in an arena that has started (gates opened) the Blizzard UI shits the bed, which also causes sArena to shit the bed. Blizzard needs to fix this.

2.3.3
- TBC: Warrior stances now show up as auras on sArena like normal (workaround required for TBC since they not *real* auras)
- Localization added. Currently supports English and Korean. Thank you to 007bb for contributing.

2.3.2b
- Remove shared CD from Will of the Forsaken in TBC
- Remove Thorns from aura list in TBC

2.3.2
- TBC aura list cleanup and added a few things.

2.3.1e
- Fix alpha issue on stealth units.

2.3.1d
- Fix interrupts on channel spells not showing due to workaround for non-working Blizzard API being set up slightly wrong in some refactoring.

2.3.1c
- Add temporary icon for missing trinket texture (will get the retail texture eventualy)

2.3.1b
- Fixup TBC stuff.
- Add a guard for potential DR error, will print error msg, please report back.

2.3.1
- Add Wrath support

2.3.0
- New Shadowsight Timer setting (Global). Enabled by default on TBC, off on others.
- New "Color DR Cooldown Text by Severity" setting (Global -> DR) (Does not work with OmniCC).
- Lots of tweaks to fix minor things. Class Icon texture appearing above borders (after rework) for example.
- Midnight: Fix a couple of DR related things.
- Midnight: Fix test DR frames to show the correct new Midnight icons (these are still not possible to change, and honestly probably wont be cuz Blizzard)

2.2.9b
- Fix "blocked action" error due to a whoops.
- Rework Class Icon stuff behind the scenes, fixes some minor issues too.
- Fix Spec Text disappearing on unit death and not showing again on shuffle round change because I forgot about shuffle for the millionth time.
- Fix TBC clickable frames in arena.

2.2.9
- Add health/mana background texture & color settings.
- Fix Pixelated layout's ClassIconCooldown not showing.
- Fix DR BorderFrame's FrameLevel to also be increased after the main DR Frame's FrameLevel increase.

2.2.8
- A lot of work done towards TBC, it should now be in a decent state. Will probably require a decent bit of tweaks and spells etc. Any support is appreciated.
- Midnight: Tweak DR Borders with new available API so can actually hide the previous border instead of just overlapping it.
- Raise DR Frames' FrameLevel a bit.

2.2.7
- Fix health percent causing lua errors on Midnight due to new changes.
- Fix DR swipe color not being set on the new Midnight DR Frames.
- Minor tweak to DR swipe color, making it a little bit more transparent by default.

2.2.6c
- Minor tweaks

2.2.6b
- Midnight: Fix a new "secret" error.
- Midnight: Fix cooldown numbers on CC.
- Midnight: Fix red DR Text being out of position.

2.2.6
- New "DR Text" size and position settings in the Layout: Text Settings section. (The DR amount text, not the cooldown text)
- "Spec Names on Manabar" setting now available in Layout settings for all layouts and not just a few of them.
- New "Disable Overshields" setting (Global -> Misc)
- Fix DR Icons unintentionally staying cropped when DR Border was disabled (and Cropped Icons was not enabled)
- Fix spam errors (every frame) due to decimals no longer being available on Midnight due to restrictions. (Potentially theres a different method later on, will look into it)
- Fix Gladiuish layout's Trinket, Racial & Dispel default size from 41 to 40. You might have to retweak size/position. Apologies for the inconvenience. Boring info: They were larger than the frames height because the default icons (when not cropped) have an ugly and inconsistent border around them and it was done to make them at least appear visually the same. However this just caues headache with both the cooldown spiral on top and also when crop borders is enabled. Should now be pixel perfect even though it may not look like it without cropped icons setting, feel free to tweak that with size if you want

2.2.5b
- Fix health & mana number formatting having some leftover code from Midnight work.

2.2.5
- Add Mes Profile (www.twitch.tv/notmes)
- Fix some potential click issues if reload during arena, like spec icon button eating clicks.

2.2.4b
- Midnight: Fix health & mana percent setting causing lua errors due to secrets. Use new Midnight API to fix.
- Midnight: Make the Reload UI warning not moveable because some people (Raiku) just kept dragging it off screen. This Reload is needed for DR's to function due to Blizzard Beta Edit Mode bugs.

2.2.4
- Midnight: Some more tweaks to try ensure DR frame does not bug out. However since the DR Frames is from Blizzard now any taint in the game has a high potential of just breaking them. It's awesome stuff really.

2.2.3c
- Retail & MoP: Fix Feign Death sometimes resetting all DRs on the Hunter. In some cases the Feign Death aura does not get registered, causing DRs to reset before this version. Cool stuff.

2.2.3b
- Midnight: Fix DR Frames not showing after leaving smth in the wrong state after testing.

2.2.3
- Fix Target & Focus & Party Target Widgets not working after an efficiency change a while ago and forgetting to change the function call.
- Midnight: Also fixed the targeting Widgets on Midnight.

2.2.2f
- Midnight: Hide the DR Frames sticking out in when in Edit Mode.

2.2.2e
- Midnight: Force reload on first arena as well. (Waiting for Blizzard to fix DRs & Edit Mode)

2.2.2d
- Few more fixes for Midnight.
- Root cause for DR frames failing on Midnight found: Edit Mode. Welcome back Dragonflight. I've added a *strongly encouraged* reload button that pops up when you enter Arena. This is good practice during a Beta anyway.

2.2.2c
- Few more fixes for Midnight.

2.2.2b
- Midnight fixes and workarounds.

2.2.2 Midnight
- Midnight should now work. More details at end of notes.
- New streamer profiles import page in the "Share Profiles" tab. Aeghis, Nahj & Pmake available atm, thank you all <3
- New layout: BlizzRaid
- New Castbar color settings.
- New Castbar "No interrupt ready" color setting. (BBF version is better, this one is currently made with Midnight in mind but might see tweaks in the future. If using BBF just keep using that.)
- New Castbar un-interruptible texture setting.
- New "Reverse Bars Fill" setting that reverses health and power fill direction.
- Target Indicator is now enabled by default on the newer Layouts.It may have turned on for you and if you don't want it turn it off in the Layout settings -> Widgets.
- Revert the hiding of dark mode & frame color settings on layouts where it makes less sense, since they can still be used to color the castbar.


Does NOT work:
- Most auras except for whatever CC Blizzard wants us to see.
- Absorb overlay (potential tweaks for that inc later, or just an absorb number)
- Diminishing Returns settings are wonky and theres a few issues. They will see more work moving forward, heres the current (and maybe permanent) issues:
1. DR: I cannot control each individual DR icons position. You will still be able to move them around and resize them though but more on that in the next three points.
2. DR: Grow up and grow down settings no longer work. Grow left and right does. Up and down will just default to grow left instead for now until I clean things up later down the road towards Midnight release.
3. DR: Gap setting no longer works.
- Maybe other things I've forgot to mention.


2.2.1
- Add option to disable all auras from Class/Spec icon.
- Retail: Add missing Surge of Power root from aura list (existed as DR). Ty Jaime.
- Midnight support should be around the corner but I need to wait for skirmishes to actually test it and make sure first and probably make some tweaks.

2.2.0
- Separate Dark Mode color from BetterBlizzFrames' dark mode so you can change it to a different value than the rest of your UI. Your dark mode value might need re-adjusting because of this if you were using BBF dark mode plus sArena dark mode.
- Add two new options to Class Color FrameTexture: Only color icon borders & Color healer green. This will only show up on layouts supporting it (that have borders on class icon specifically)
- Class Color FrameTexture now also works on Pixelated layout.
- Hide some settings in the Global section for layouts where they dont apply (for example dark mode for Xaryu layout, since there are no borders to dark mode)
- Fix castbar texture change not sticking during arenas on the default castbars.
- Temporary tweak to MoP's BlizzCompact layout with its cooldown edge texture: use circle edge instead to avoid the edge sticking out on the corners. Not sure how to fix this properly yet on MoP.

2.1.9
- Fix potential castbar coloring issues with Modern Castbar + Custom texture instead of the default ones.
- Potential fix for some MoP+Human racial settings. Unable to test cuz no test environment. No PTR, no lvl 90, no skirmishes, gg.

2.1.8
- Add new DR settings and tweak them a bit.
- New DR Thin Pixel Border setting.
- New DR Hide Glow setting.

- Other layouts than Pixelated can now have the Thick Pixel DR Border / Thin Pixel DR Border setting.
- Tweak a few aura priorities.
- Remove Upheaval from Knock DR's.
- Focus Indicator no longer enabled by default for Blizz Compact layout.
- Due to an oversight after combining Retail & MoP version into one version I've had to reset DR Reset Time back to their default value (18.5 on Retail and 20 on MoP). Also fix DR Reset Time description on MoP. It had the Retail description and was inaccurate.

2.1.7
- One new layout: Blizz Compact
- Four new features in layout settings in new Widgets section:
1. Target Indicator: Show icon on your current target

- Fix DR Categories not respecting per spec & per class settings due to falling back to global settings like how Static Icons work, oops.

2.1.5
- Priest's Purify now displays a stack number on it if double dispel. At 0 stacks it gets desaturated. At 1 or more stacks it stays colored.
- Add options to disable desaturation on Trinket & Dispel CD (Global -> Arena Frames -> Misc).
- Re-enable manabar text and add settings to show/hide it and position settings etc. Disabled by default.
- Tweak layouts a little: Removed font outline on spec name text for Retail layout. Add font outline to the old Arena & Xaryu layout's health & mana text (as it used to be, this got unintentionally removed with new font settings).
- Fix racials not updating properly between shuffle rounds.

2.1.4
- New "Simple Castbar" setting for Modern Castbars. Removes text background and puts text inside of the castbar.
- Tweak to make sure "Swap Trinket with Human Racial" setting works even when Human racial is turned off.

- Color Trinket setting now completely hides Trinket spot when they don't have a Trinket instead of showing a red color (to emphasize they dont have a trinket, instead of it "being on cd").

2.0.9
- New setting: Class Color FrameTexture. Class color the border on frames.
- Dark Mode Color Value is now adjustable and also has a Desaturate toggle. (if BetterBlizzFrames is enabled it still gets its value from there to be consistent)
